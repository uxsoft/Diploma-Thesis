Process Simulate by Siemens is the industry standard in the area of assembly line design software. 
It allows the manufacturers to plan and validate an assembly line long before breaking the ground.
This work strives to help the users improve the quality of their designs by providing them with an optimization plugin.
This plugin provides a user interface to the included optimization algorithm which, aims to minimize the cycle time while avoiding any collisions. 
First, it analyzes the robotic cell and the operation and then it adjusts the operation according to the optimal solution found by the algorithm. 
The plugin was built with modularity in mind so that it can be extended with more sophisticated optimization algorithms in the future.
