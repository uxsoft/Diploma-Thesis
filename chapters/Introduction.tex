\section{Intro}
Nowadays in the manufacturing industry most of the production is automated. Parts are created in so called robotic cells. A robotic cell is basically an assembly line with robots. In the center of the cell would be typically a conveyor belt or a robot which is tasked by moving the part around, facilitating   When developing a new product . This way 

The assembly lines are designed by humans in a CAD software. One example of such software is the Tecnomatix suite by SIEMENS.

\subsection{Motivation}
The goal of this work is to take the human design and using a mathematical model of the assembly line to find the optimal schedule
