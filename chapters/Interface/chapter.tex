This chapter I'd like to acquaint the reader with Process Simulate, its inner workings and the programming interface (API) which I used to develop this solution. The reason I present this chapter is to familiarize the users with the terminology and internal processes used in the next chapter (\ref{ch:integration}). First I will explain the tool from the users perspective which should help the user better picture what we try to achieve and how. Then I will describe the most relevant aspects of the API. I will also go through how to accomplish the most common programming exercise, writing Process Simulate plugins.
